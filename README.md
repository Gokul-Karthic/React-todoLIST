# TodoList Application

This is a simple React-based TodoList application that allows users to add, view, and delete tasks. The application uses `localStorage` to persist the tasks, ensuring that the list remains intact even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add tasks to the list by typing into the input field and clicking the "Add" button.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks from the list by clicking the trash icon next to each task.
- **Persistent Storage**: The tasks are saved in the browser's `localStorage`, so they remain available even after a page reload.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **FontAwesome**: For the trash icon used in the delete functionality.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## File Structure

- **`App.jsx`**: The main component that contains the logic and UI for the TodoList application.

## Code Overview

### State Management

- **`todos`**: An array that stores the list of tasks. It is initialized from `localStorage` if available.
- **`input`**: A string that stores the current value of the input field.

### Functions

- **`handleChange`**: Updates the `input` state as the user types in the input field.
- **`handleSubmit`**: Adds a new task to the `todos` array and clears the input field.
- **`handleDelete`**: Removes a task from the `todos` array based on its index.
- **`useEffect`**: Saves the `todos` array to `localStorage` whenever it changes.

### Components

- **Input Field**: Allows users to type in a new task.
- **Add Button**: Submits the new task to the list.
- **Task List**: Displays the list of tasks with a delete button for each task.

### Example Code Snippet

```jsx
const handleDelete = (index) => {
  const newTodos = [...todos];
  newTodos.splice(index, 1);
  setTodos(newTodos);
};
```

## Styling

The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling, with a gradient background and responsive design. The task list is scrollable, and the buttons have hover effects for better user experience.

## Dependencies

- `react`
- `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome`
- `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons`
- `tailwindcss`

## Future Enhancements

- Add an "Edit Task" feature.
- Add a "Mark as Completed" feature.
